<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>PullApprove is configured by a <code>.pullapprove.yml</code> file, which is placed
in the root of your repo.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to organize your reviews into review <code>groups</code>. Groups might
be split by language or specific areas of your codebase, or
instead might be different types of review that need to be done (e.g. "security"
or "design").</p>

<p>However you decide to organize your groups, you can use the group <code>conditions</code>
to determine when each group is asked to review a PR. When the conditions are met, the group is considered <em>active</em>.</p>

<p>When it is your turn to provide a review, we'll add you as a "requested
reviewer" in GitHub. To review the PR, use the interface on github.com to
approve or request changes.</p>

<p>A PR is considered approved when all <em>active</em> groups have submitted
the required number of approvals. When this happens, we'll send a "success" status check to GitHub,
which you can make a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/enabling-required-status-checks">requirement of any protected branches</a>.</p>
