<h1>Extends</h1>

<p>Your repo config file can "extend" an existing config file that lives
somewhere else. This makes it easy re-use configurations across your
organization and/or base your configuration off of a template.</p>

<p>Templates need to be accessible via a URL. Any publicly accessible HTTPS URL
will work. You can also point us to a private GitHub repo URL within the same
organization where the GitHub App is installed (e.g. <code>https://api.github.com/repos/example/pullapprove-config/contents/.pullapprove.yml</code>).</p>

{% code "yaml" %}{% raw %}
# you need at least these 2 fields to extend a template
version: 3
extends: https://api.github.com/repos/example/pullapprove-config/contents/.pullapprove.yml
{% endraw %}{% endcode %}

{#
<h2>Deep merging</h2>

<p>When you extend a template <em>and</em> provide settings in the <code>.pullapprove.yml</code> file itself,
the settings will be merged together.</p>
