<h1>Notifications</h1>

<p>PullApprove provides an easy way insert automated comments at specific times
in your process. These can be used to communicate helpful tips to contributors
and first-timers, instruct reviewers, or boost morale ðŸŽ‰.</p>

<p>Notifications are triggered based on "events". Most of the events come
directly from GitHub, and a few are added by us.</p>

{% code "yaml" %}{% raw %}
version: 3
notifications:
- when: pull_request.opened
  comment: |
    Hey @{{ author }}, thanks for the PR! The review will start once
    the tests and CI checks have passed. You'll also need to sign our
    CLA if you haven't before.
- when: pullapprove.approved
  if: "author_association == 'CONTRIBUTOR'"
  comment: "The review is completed. Thanks @{{ author }}, we'll take it from here."

groups:
  ...
{% endraw %}{% endcode %}

<h2>Filtering with "if"</h2>

<p>You can filter out events based on the state of the PR by adding an
<code>if</code> condition. This is written just like any other <a
href="/config/conditions/">condition</a> but you also have access to an
<code>event</code> object.</p>

{% code "yaml" %}{% raw %}
notifications:
- when: pullapprove.approved
  if: "author_association == 'CONTRIBUTOR'"
  comment: The review is completed. Thanks @{{ author }}, we'll take it from here.
{% endraw %}{% endcode %}

<h2>GitHub Events and Context</h2>

<p>The <code>when</code> field of notifications should match the
<code>{webhook_event_name}.{action}</code> as it was sent from GitHub. For
example, when a pull request is opened you would say <code>when:
pull_request.opened</code>. Within the <code>comment</code> field you also have
access to an additional set of data under the variable name <code>event</code>
&mdash; which gives you access to the webhook data from GitHub.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

{% code "yaml" %}{% raw %}
notifications:
- when: pull_request.edited
  comment: "@{{ event.sender}} edited this PR."
{% endraw %}{% endcode %}

<p>For a full reference of GitHub webhook event names and available data, <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/">look here.</a></p>

<p>PullApprove receives these events from GitHub.</p>

<h2>PullApprove Events</h2>

<p>These custom events are made by PullApprove itself, so that you can also send
notifications at specific times in the broader review workflow.</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-4">
  <li><code>pullapprove.started</code> - the first time that PullApprove sends a "pending" status for the PR (e.g. groups have been activated)</li>
  <li><code>pullapprove.approved</code> - when there are active groups, and they have all approved the PR</li>
  <li><code>pullapprove.group.requested_reviewers</code> - any time review requests are created by PullApprove, comes with <code>event.group</code> and <code>event.requested_reviewers</code> that you can us in the comment template</li>
  <li><code>pullapprove.group.unrequested_reviewers</code> - any time review requests are removed by PullApprove, comes with <code>event.group</code> and <code>event.unrequested_reviewers</code> that you can us in the comment template</li>
</ul>
