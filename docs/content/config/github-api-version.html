<h1>GitHub API Version</h1>

<p>PullApprove does not officially support new GitHub features until they are out of "preview" and suitable for
  production use. If you want to build your workflow around preview features,
  you need to enable them manually by setting the <code>github_api_version</code> for your repo. Doing this will change
  the data that PullApprove receives from GitHub, and might give you access to new variables when writing conditions.
</p>

<p>Just remember &mdash; they are in preview for a reason! Keep an eye out for potential API changes while in preview
  and don't be too surprised if something behaves unexpectedly.
</p>

<p>The list of current GitHub.com API previews can be found here: <a
