<h1>PullApprove Conditions</h1>

<p><code>pullapprove_conditions</code> allow you to determine which PRs need to
be reviewed and which don't. Often times, people don't need to review "work in
progress" PRs or PRs that are being merge into specific branches (i.e. for
further development or testing). This is a top-level setting which completely
enables or disables PullApprove (including <a
href="/config/notifications/">notifications</a>).</p>

<p>By default there are no <code>pullapprove_conditions</code> and every PR is
up for review (depending on the conditions of each group). If not specified (see
below), PullApprove will return a "success" status to GitHub if any conditions
are not met so that PRs are still mergeable if PullApprove is a required status
check. To change the status or the explanation that goes with it, you can use
the more complex syntax for defining conditions.</p>

{% code "yaml" %}
version: 3
pullapprove_conditions:
- "'WIP' not in title"  # only review if not marked as work in progress
- "base.ref == 'master'"  # only review things being merged into master
- "'*travis*' in statuses.successful"  # only review if tests have already passed
- "'hotfix' not in labels"  # let hotfix PRs go through without review

# review groups are only evaluated if all of the pullapprove_conditions are true
groups:
  ...
{% endcode %}

<p>For more details on what kinds of conditions you can write, <a href="/config/conditions/">look here</a>.</p>

<h2>Changing the status or explanation</h2>

<p>You can further tweak the behavior of <code>pullapprove_conditions</code> by
specifying the status and explanation that are returned to GitHub when one of
the conditions is not met. The conditions are evaluated in order, and the first
one to fail will be the one to set the status and explanation in GitHub.</p>

{% code "yaml" %}
version: 3
pullapprove_conditions:
- condition: "base.ref == 'master'"
  unmet_status: success
  explanation: "Review not required unless merging to master"
- "'hotfix' not in labels"  # when using the string type, the default status is "success"
- condition: "'WIP' not in title"
  unmet_status: pending
  explanation: "Work in progress"
- condition: "'*travis*' in statuses.successful"
  unmet_status: failure
  explanation: "Tests must pass before review starts"

# review groups are only evaluated if all of the pullapprove_conditions are true
groups:
  ...
