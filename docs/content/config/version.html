<h1>Version</h1>

<p>The version needs to be 3! That's about all there is to it. If you are using
version 1 or 2 of PullApprove, you'll need to look at the <a
href="https://v2-docs.pullapprove.com">older documentation</a>. And we highly
recommend you <a href="/migration/">upgrade as soon as possible</a>.</p>

<div class="bg-orange-200 text-orange-800 p-4 shadow rounded mb-4">Note that the <strong>version field is
required!</strong> If you don't include it, you may not see any activity as we
will assume that you are using an older version of PullApprove which is run off
of a legacy system.</div>
