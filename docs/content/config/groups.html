<h1>Groups</h1>

<p>Review groups are the key component of PullApprove. For simple use cases, you
may only need one group. For more sophisitcated setups, groups can be used to
divide reviewers by language, specialty, role, or anything else you use to
organize your workflow. Groups can even depend on other groups to build a <a
href="/phased-reviews/">phased review process</a>.</p>

<p>Each group comes with its own rules for <a href="/config/conditions/">when they are asked to review</a>,
provides controls for how <a href="/config/reviewers/">reviewers</a> are <a href="/config/reviews/">selected</a>, and <a href="/config/reviews/">how many reviews are required for
approval</a>.</p>

groups:
  ux:  # group name
    conditions:  # the group is activated when all of these statements are true
    - ...
    reviewers:  # people who can approve for this group
      ...
    reviews:  # settings for approval and reviewer selection
      ...
