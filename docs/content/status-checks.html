<h1>Status checks</h1>

<p>While PullApprove itself is focused on the human aspect of code review, you
can integrate it with other automated static analysis checks and tests. This is
often used in order to let machines do the boring, tedious work of verifying
that code meets the style guidelines, passes test suites, is properly committed
(signed-off-by), etc. before actually bothering real people on your team to look
at PRs.</p>

<p>You can integrate with other services you're already using, or even build
your own with tools like <a href="https://probot.github.io/">probot</a>.</p>

<p>Other commit statuses can be referenced in <a
href="/config/conditions/">group conditions</a> or the overall <a
href="/config/pullapprove-conditions/">pullapprove_conditions</a>. For
example, to prevent any human review from happening until your automated tests
have passed, you could use a config like this:</p>

{% code "yaml" %}
version: 3
pullapprove_conditions:
- "'license/cla' in statuses.succeeded"
- "'*travis*' in statuses.succeeded"
- "'codeclimate' in statuses.succeeded"

groups:
  ...
