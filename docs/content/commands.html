<h1>Commands</h1>

{% markdown %}

All commands need to be made in a PR *review* comment. Just start the comment
with the "/command", and the results will be sent back to the same PR as a new
comment. Note that you cannot use /commands in the regular PR comments, because
PullApprove currently doesn't receive events for those (nuance of the GitHub App
API).

## /pullapprove-test

This command will use the rest of the comment body (optionally wrapped in a
markdown code block) and use it as the `.pullapprove.yml`. It won't actually
make any changes to the PR (like request reviewers or update the status), but it
will return the results of what *would* have happened so that you can see how
the config you tested might work differently than the one on your default
branch.
