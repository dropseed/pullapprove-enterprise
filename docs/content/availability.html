<h1>Availability</h1>

{#
<p>One of our main goals with PullApprove is to help prevent excess
notifications and noise. We all get plenty of alerts and emails from services,
and PullApprove is designed to cut down on this, not add to it.</p>
#}

<p>You can use the PullApprove "availability status" to tell us and your team
that you aren't available to review code right now. It might be for 3 hours so
you can focus, or 3 weeks for vacation.</p>

<p>When you set your status as "unavailable", your existing open PR review
requests will be removed and transferred to someone else in the group. We also
won't request you to review new PRs while you're unavailable &mdash; instead
you'll be skipped.</p>
