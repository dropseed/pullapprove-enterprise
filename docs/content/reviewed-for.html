<h1>Reviewed-for</h1>

{% markdown %}

When submitting your review, PullApprove provides the option to specify *which*
group that review is for. This allows you to review a PR multiple times, for
different purposes. Or, for example, to review a PR for "security" but leave
general "code" review for someone else. By default, a review will apply to all
groups that you are capable of reviewing for.

## Usage

Use the `Reviewed-for: groupname` syntax to specify a group. The `groupname`
should exactly match one of the groups defined in your `.pullapprove.yml`. To
apply the review to multiple groups, just comma-separate them: `Reviewed-for:
security, code`.

And the same syntax can be used to request changes for specific groups only.
