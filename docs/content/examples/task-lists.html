If GitHub PR [task lists](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-task-lists)
are an important part of your process, there is a simple way to check their
completion when writing PullApprove conditions.

For example, to ensure that the tasks are completed before
reviews are requested:

```yaml
version: 3
pullapprove_conditions:
- condition: "body and '- [ ]' not in body"
  unmet_status: pending
  explanation: "Please finish all the tasks first"
```

{% endmarkdown %}
{% endblock %}
