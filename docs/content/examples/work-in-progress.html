If pull requests are opened "early and often", then
you may not want the typical review to happen right away.

Teams have different preferences for how these are marked.

### Using labels

```yaml
version: 3
pullapprove_conditions:
- condition: "'wip' in labels"
  unmet_status: pending
  explanation: "Work in progress"
```

### Using titles

```yaml
version: 3
pullapprove_conditions:
- condition: "'WIP' in title"
  unmet_status: pending
  explanation: "Work in progress"
```

### Using "draft" pull requests

Note that this is still in API preview, so you need to [enable it](/config/github-api-version/).

```yaml
version: 3
github_api_version: "shadow-cat-preview"
pullapprove_conditions:
- condition: "not draft"
  unmet_status: pending
  explanation: "Work in progress"
```
