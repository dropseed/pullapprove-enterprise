An important aspect of PullApprove is that you have
the control to notify people only when they are needed.

For example, if Steve and Mike both need to sign off on a design
change, but Mike really only wants to look at it after Steve already has,
then you could use a config like this:

```yaml
version: 3
groups:
  design:
    reviewers:
      # the order matters!
      users:
      - steve
      - mike
    reviews:
      request: 1
      required: 2
      request_order: given
```
