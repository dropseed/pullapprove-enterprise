In organizations where code review plays a vital role in security and
business operations, you will likely want to restrict changes to the
review process itself.

In PullApprove, you can create a review group specifically for the config file
to ensure no changes are made without an admin's approval.

```yaml
version: 3
groups:
  pullapprove:
    conditions:
    - "'.pullapprove.yml' in files"
    reviewers:
      teams:
      - admins
    reviews:
      required: 1
```

{% endmarkdown %}
