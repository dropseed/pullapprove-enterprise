A common part of the pull request process for open-source projects
is to use
[Developer Certificate of Origin ("DCO")](https://developercertificate.org/).

There are tools built specifically for this purpose, but if you
are already using PullApprove then we also have a simple
variable that you can use to directly incorporate signed-off commits
into your review process.

```yaml
version: 3
pullapprove_conditions:
- condition: "commits.are_signed_off"
  unmet_status: "pending"
  explanation: "Commits need to be signed-off before review starts"
```

{% endmarkdown %}
