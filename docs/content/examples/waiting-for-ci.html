With good tests and other static analysis and linters in place,
you can let computers take care of pointing out the obvious. Human
review can then focus on what people are good at.

Use `pullapprove_conditions` to make sure the author
takes care of everything your automated checks can help with
before bothering real people.

```yaml
version: 3
pullapprove_conditions:
- condition: "'*travis*' in statuses.successful"
  unmet_status: "failure"
  explanation: "Tests must pass before review starts"
```
