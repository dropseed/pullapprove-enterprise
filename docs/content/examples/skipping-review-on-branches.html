If your workflow involves frequently opening PRs to merge
into a "development" or "staging" branch, you likely don't
want it to go through the same review process as merging to
"production" or "master".

You can use conditions on either the base *or* head branch
details to decide which process to use.

### Skip review entirely

```yaml
version: 3
pullapprove_conditions:
- condition: "base.ref == 'master'"
  unmet_status: success
  explanation: "Review not required unless merging to master"
```

### Set up separate review groups based on branches

```yaml
version: 3
groups:
  staging:
    conditions:
    - "base.ref == 'staging'"
    reviewers:
      teams:
      - staging-reviewers
  master:
    conditions:
    - "base.ref == 'master'"
    reviewers:
      teams:
      - admins
```
