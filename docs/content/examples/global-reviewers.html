Add a "global" group which can override/deactivate
other groups if they need to step in and approve a PR immediately.

```yaml
version: 3
groups:
  global:
    type: optional
    reviewers:
      teams:
      - global
    reviews:
      request: 0
      required: 1
      reviewed_for: required

  code:
    conditions:
    - "global not in groups.approved"
    ...
```
