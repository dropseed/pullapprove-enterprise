Labels can be a great, visual indicator of which topics a pull request covers or
which phase of review it is in.

You can use the `labels` variable when writing conditions to automatically
assign reviewers based on how the author or other collaborators label the PR.

This can be especially useful for situations where names of the files changed
don't give you enough insight into what *kind* of change is actually being made
(e.g. is modifying a "*.js" file in React a design tweak or a new feature?).

```yaml
version: 3
groups:
  design:
    conditions:
    - "'ui/ux' in labels"
    reviewers:
      teams:
      - design
```
