Labels can be a great, visual indicator of what topics a pull request covers or
which phase of review it is in.

You can use the `labels` variable when writing conditions to automatically
assign reviewers based on how the author or other collaborators label the PR.

```yaml
version: 3
groups:
  design:
    conditions:
    - "'ui/ux' in labels"
    reviewers:
      teams:
      - design
```

{% endmarkdown %}
