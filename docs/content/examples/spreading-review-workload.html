If you have a large team and want everyone to be involved in code review, randomly assigning reviewers
can be an easy way to distribute the work.

The following config will randomly choose 2 reviewers for each new pull request.
```yaml
version: 3
groups:
  code-review:
    reviewers:
      teams:
      - everybody
    reviews:
      request: 2
      request_order: random
```
{% endmarkdown %}

{% endblock %}
