Setting expectations is important when someone opens their first pull request.
They should know what is expected of them, and what they can expect to see during the review process.

A well-written automated comment can go a long way in giving the contributor a sense of
what will happen, and removing some of the burden from the maintainers/admins.

    Hey @{{ author }}, thanks for the PR! The review will start once
    the tests and CI checks have passed. If they don't, please review
    the logs and try to fix the issues (ask for help if you can't
    figure it out). A reviewer will be assigned once the tests are
    passing and they'll walk you through getting the PR finished
    and merged.
