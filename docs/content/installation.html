<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>PullApprove is installed as a GitHub App. You can either choose specific
repos within your organization, or install it for all repos in an
organization.</p>

<p>We will only report a status check to GitHub if you have a
<code>.pullapprove.yml</code> file using <code>version: 3</code> in the repo.
Versions 1 and 2 were built using the original OAuth integration system, and can
still be used side-by-side with version 3.</p>
