<h1>Phased reviews</h1>

<p>With advanced use of the <a href="/config/conditions/">conditions</a> setting,
  you can set up reviews to be done in "phases", or happen in separate steps.</p>

<p>This is particularly useful if there are certain people that you don't want to
  bug until other parts of the review have been completed &mdash; either because their
  time is more valuable or because their area of review isn't necessary until
  other aspects have already been approved.</p>

<p>You can set this up by making groups depend on other groups. The
<code>groups</code> variable comes with a <a
href="/config/conditions/#groups">set of convenient properties</a> for
checking the state of other groups.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Groups are evaluated <em>in order</em>, and the
<code>groups</code> variable only contains the preceding groups when you write
<a href="/config/conditions/">conditions</a>.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h4>Code review first</h4>

{% code "yaml" %}{% raw %}
version: 3

groups:
  code:
    ...

  database:
    ...
    conditions:
    # only asked to review once the other 2 groups are finished (or are not applicable)
    - "'code' in groups.approved"
{% endraw %}{% endcode %}

<h4>Fallback review group</h4>

<p>You can implement a "fallback" set of reviewers by placing the group last,
and checking whether any of the previous groups have been activated (i.e.
conditions met).</p>

{% code "yaml" %}{% raw %}
version: 3

groups:
  code:
    ...

  database:
    ...

  fallback:
    ...
    conditions:
    # this group is asked to review if no previous groups match this PR
    - "len(groups.active) == 0"  # or "not groups.active"
{% endraw %}{% endcode %}

{% endblock %}
