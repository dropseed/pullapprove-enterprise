steps:
  - run: "./node_modules/.bin/tailwind build ./content/assets/css/_tailwind.dev.css -c ./content/assets/css/_tailwind.config.js -o ./output/assets/css/main.css"
    watch:
      - "./content/*/_tailwind.config.js"
      - "./content/*/_tailwind.dev.css"
variables:
  # TODO need to be able to change these in build command
  # check other enterprise settings (site name, twitter, etc.)
  # need ENV var too so can put in netlify directly? should they be force uppercase _ to match that? all page variables won't be that way
  # could have an option to choose env var to populate from? then can use other built ins -- set git commit to netlify commit sha, etc.
  # need configyaml on this
  # or could have env_variables -> map to variable name, don't like that though (they are all variables)
