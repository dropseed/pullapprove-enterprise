PullApprove lets teams build automated code review workflows.
Use custom rules to decide exactly who needs to review which pull requests,
and PullApprove will send review requests and track approval requirements.

This repo contains a base set of Terraform files for PullApprove Enteprise customers to build off of.
PullApprove itself is not open-source.

We run a [hosted service](https://www.pullapprove.com/) and GitHub App that you can quickly install and use.
We also have a self-hosted [PullApprove Enterprise](https://www.pullapprove.com/enterprise/) for large teams using GitHub Enterprise.
