PullApprove is a tool for organizing and automating code review workflows for teams.

This repo contains the open-sourced components of it,
but the key pieces are still proprietary.

We run a [hosted service](https://www.pullapprove.com/) and GitHub App that you can quickly install and use.
We also sell a self-hosted [PullApprove Enterprise](https://www.pullapprove.com/enterprise/) for large teams using GitHub Enterprise.
