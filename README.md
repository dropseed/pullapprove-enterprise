PullApprove lets teams build automated code review workflows.
Use custom rules to decide exactly who needs to review which pull requests,
and PullApprove will send review requests and track approval requirements.

This repo contains a base set of Terraform files for PullApprove Enteprise customers to build off of.
PullApprove itself is not open-source.

We run a [hosted service](https://www.pullapprove.com/) for GitHub and Bitbucket that you can quickly install and use with their hosted services.
We also have a self-hosted [PullApprove Enterprise](https://www.pullapprove.com/enterprise/) for larger teams using GitHub and Bitbucket (cloud or self-hosted).
This repo will give you a rough idea of how that is deployed, but [let us know if you have questions](https://www.pullapprove.com/contact/).
